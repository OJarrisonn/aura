# Aura

Aura is a programming language for application development.
Aura tries to bring functional programming and OOP features together to create high-level applications.

Aura also uses lazyzess and multi-threading to improve performance of applications. Every value in Aura is lazily copied, it means, just the necessary parts are actually copied when modified. Also, pure and independent code execution is delegated to parallel threads.
