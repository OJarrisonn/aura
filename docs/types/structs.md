# Structs: Product Types

Structs are a specialization of compounds where each part is indexed by an identifier as `(v1 T1, v2 T2, ..., vn Tn)`.

## Casting

Since compounds are said more general than structs, the compound `(T1, T2, ..., Tn)` can be auto casted into a struct `(v1 T1, v2 T2, ..., vn Tn)`.
